Python for Humans
=================

This website will:

- establish a "manifesto" for change in the python ecosystem, encouraging developer experience best practices
- complement python.org by offering an opinionated and curated list of tools that should be adopted (readthedocs, crate.io, etc)
- be a platform for new "campaigns" (e.g. 'use pip/distribute' or 'stop supporting 2.5 to ease porting to 3')
